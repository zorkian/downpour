Welcome to Downpour, the BitTorrent client libraries for Perl.

This set of modules is designed to do everything you need to enable you
to quickly and easily create a BitTorrent frontend letting Downpour do
all of the work.

Some of the envisioned applications are programs that enable remote
management of the BitTorrent client, multi-torrent managers that will
download multiple torrents at a time, seeding programs that will
intelligently seed everything you put in a certain directory to enable
usage more like traditional p2p applications... the list goes on.

As it stands, if you are just looking at having a very bare frontend that
you can access with a web browser to see status, Downpour already does all
of that for you.

Also, at the moment, Downpour doesn't support everything that other
BitTorrent clients support.  Multi-file torrents, for one.  I'm sure there
are other parts of the system unsupported, but I don't remember them right
now.  For standard torrent files, it works fine, though.

If you have any questions... please feel free to email me or use the
SourceForge forums that have been setup.  Please also file bugs there, as
then everything can stay together.
